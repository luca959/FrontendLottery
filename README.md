## Smart Contract Implementation

The smart contract utilizes a data structure called `Ticket` that contains all information related to a ticket:

- `date` of ticket purchase
- `Name` of the ticket purchaser
- `Surname` of the ticket purchaser
- `Matricola` of the user automatically assigned upon ticket purchase

Additionally, the smart contract mainly uses two arrays and a dictionary:

- `uint256[] LotteryParticipants;`
    - This array stores the matricolas of users who have purchased tickets * the number of tickets purchased.
        
        Example: Luca bought 3 tickets, while Marina bought 1 ticket.
        
        | Id(Luca) | Id(Luca) | Id(Luca) | Id(Marina) |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- |
- `uint256[] LotteryKey;`
    - Simply contains all the participant ids.
- `mapping(uint256 => Ticket) LotteryFeed;`
    - Within `LotteryFeed`, each id is mapped to the information of the user who bought the ticket.

The available functions within the smart contract are as follows:

- `getLastTicketSold()`
    - Every time a ticket is sold, the variable `last` is updated with the id generated for that ticket. This variable is then used to retrieve the last sold ticket's information from `LotteryFeed`.
    - This function can only be executed by the owner of the contract.
- `GetNumOfParticipants()`
    - Returns the length of `LotteryKey`. Anyone can execute this function.
- `GetAllParticipants()`
    - Iterates over the length of `LotteryKey`, saving the result of `LotteryFeed[LotteryKey[i]]` in an array.
    - This function can only be executed by the owner of the contract.
- `removeIndex()`
    - Called by `Extraction()` to swap positions between the matricola at index `randNo` and the matricola at index `lastItem`. The value of `LotteryPartecipants[randNo]` is saved in `winner`, and then `LotteryPartecipants.pop()` is performed.
- `Extraction()`
    - Assigns a random value between 0 and `LotteryPartecipants.length` to `randNo`, increments `randNonce` to change the seed, and then calls `removeIndex()`.
    - This function can only be executed by the owner of the contract.
- `Winner()`
    - Retrieves `LotteryFeed[winner]`.
    - This function can only be executed by the owner of the contract.
- `SellTicket()`
    - Requires that `name` and `surname` be greater than 0 characters but less than 256 characters, the `NumOfTickets` purchased is >0 and <100 and the user `id` is >0 and <1000.
    - `SellTicket` takes in in put the **`name, surname`** and the `**id**`
        
        if the id doesnâ€™t exist in Lottery feed then is added to it, and add for the NumOfTicket the id in LotteryPartecipants, otherwise we donâ€™t need to add in LotteryFeed the id because it already exists and we simply add in LotteryPartecipants the id x NumOfTickets
        
    - This function can only be executed by the owner of the contract.
- `closeLottery()`
    - Empties the following variables and arrays:
        - `writers;`
        - `LotteryFeed`
        - `LotteryParticipants;`
        - `id;`
        - `last;`
        - `LotteryKey;`
        - `winner;`
        - `randNo;`
        - `randNonce;`
    - This function can only be executed by the owner of the contract.
    
    ## Front-end Implementation
    
    The implementation of the front-end is strongly based from this guide .
    
    As frontend Framework I use React and as provider I use Infura instead of Alchemy.
    
    I put the InfuraProvider inside a .env file, in order to hide my API key.
